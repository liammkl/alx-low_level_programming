0x09. C - Static libraries

Tasks:

Task 0: To emphasize, a library is not an extravagance; rather, it is a fundamental necessity of life. The objective is to establish the static library libmy.a, which will encompass all the functions detailed below. If any of these functions haven't been implemented, create empty ones with the correct prototypes. Ensure that you push your main.h file to your repository, which should include, at the very least, all the function prototypes mentioned above.

Task 1: In the absence of libraries, what do we possess? We lack both a history and a future. Create a script, denominated create_static_lib.sh, which is responsible for crafting a static library named liball.a, using all the .c files present in the current directory.
