Description of the Project
In this project, we are working with singly linked lists. We have a set of functions and a header file that contains the necessary definitions and prototypes for our project. The key data structure we use is called list_t, which is a structure consisting of a string str, an unsigned integer len, and a pointer to the next element next.
List of Functions in the Project
Print List
File: 0-print_list.c
Description: This C function is responsible for printing all the elements of a list_t list. If the str is NULL, it prints "[0] (nil)."
List Length
File: 1-list_len.c
Description: This C function calculates and returns the number of elements in a linked list_t list.
Add Node
File: 2-add_node.c
Description: This C function adds a new node to the beginning of a list_t list. If it fails, it returns NULL. Otherwise, it returns the address of the new element.
Add Node at the End
File: 3-add_node_end.c
Description: This C function adds a new node to the end of a linked list_t list. If it fails, it returns NULL. Otherwise, it returns the address of the new element.
Free List
File: 4-free_list.c
Description: This C function is responsible for freeing the memory allocated to a list_t list.
The Hare and the Tortoise
File: 100-first.c
Description: This C function prints "You're beat! and yet, you must allow,\nI bore my house upon my back!" before the main function is executed.
Real Programmers Can Write Assembly Code in Any Language
File: 101-hello_holberton.asm
Description: This is a 64-bit assembly program that prints "Hello, Holberton" followed by a new line using only the printf function without interrupts
